# MEC647, Complex Crack Propagation in Briittle Materials
## 2021/22 Ed., Master ENSTA Paris Tech, Polytechnique

From little or nothing, to experimental verification of a complex fracture experiment.
To understand fracture, simple ingredients: one energetic evolution law, one irreversibility constraint, and a whole class of elliptic models.

This repository contains all course material to solving fracture problems arising in solid mechanics with
the variational approach. 
Contents include: scripts and material data.
The computational environment is based on DOLFINx. 

### Running the notebooks (to be tested *prior* to course start)

To run a Docker container on a local machine.

1. Install Docker following the instructions at
   https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop.

2. Clone this repository using git:

       git clone https://github.com/kumiori/mec647.git

3. Run `./launcher.sh`.
4. 
Although we recommend using Docker locally, you can also use the cloud-based Google Colab service to execute the notebooks:

### Prerequisites

The course will assume basic knowledge of the theory of infinitesimal elasticity and
finite element methods.

Basic knowledge of Python will be assumed, see https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython
to brush up if you feel unsure.
