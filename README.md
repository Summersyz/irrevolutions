# Crack Propagation in Brittle Materials
## 2024

`Irrevolutions` is a computational stability-analyis toolkit designed to solve nonlinear and nonconvex evolutionary problems using advanced numerical methods. It provides efficient algorithms for computing solutions constrained minimum problems with application to irreversible evolutions (hence its name). In particular, this framework is relevant in the context of fracture and damage mechanics.

**Irreversible Evolution of Damage**
 
Let $y=(\alpha, u)$ be an admissible state of a brittle system where $\alpha: \Omega \mapsto [0, 1]$ is a smooth damage field which identifies cracks (where $\alpha =1$) and $u$ is a displacement field. Provided a material model (an energy) $E_\ell$, given a time horizon $T$, let's find a map $t \in [0, T]\mapsto y_t$ such that: damage is non-decreasing and the observed state $y_t$ is energy-minimal, among admissible variations.

### To run the code (on Docker)

First, run the container, attaching an interactive session and sharing data space 
(the current dir) between the host and the container (the syntax is origin:target).

On an ARM-based machine:
```
docker run --rm -ti -v "$(pwd)":/home/numerix -w /home/numerix kumiori3/numerix:stable
```
On an AMD64 machine:
```
docker run --rm -ti -v "$(pwd)":/home/numerix -w /home/numerix kumiori3/numerix:stable-amd64
```

On a windows box:
```
docker run --rm -ti -v "C:/...":/home/numerix" -w /home/numerix kumiori3\numerix:stable-amd64
```

### Installation

To install the software, run DOLFINx through the aforementioned docker container and install the irrevolutions-package with 

```python3 -m pip install .```

from the root of this repository
